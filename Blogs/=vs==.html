    <h1><strong>= VS. ==</strong></h1>
    <p>One tricky thing in programming is the concept of equals versus == (which is a comparative method). "==" is comparing two things, saying that something is the same as something else without changing its value. It may be that a statement made with "==" is in fact false. The "=" equal method is saying that no matter what, something is the same thing as something, essentially setting its value.</p>
