    <h1><strong>Scanner</strong></h1>
    <p>Java has many built in tools that we merely need to call on to utilize. But there are some tools that you don't always need, and thus are not by default included in java unless you specifically import them in to your individual project you are working on. It is called upon with "import java.util.Scanner;" In this case, the java refers to the language and library it is being inmported from.</p>
