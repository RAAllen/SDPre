    <h1><strong>Changing a Double to an Integer</strong></h1>
    <p>Java has many number types, including doubles, which can be quite complex and lengthy, and integers, which are fairly simple. There are times when you need to change a double to an integer, especially if you want to have precision for carrying out a formula, but then don't really need to display that precision to your audience. All that really happens when you cast a double to an int is that you are visually truncating the number to your audience. It doesn't actually change the value inside the stored number, it just temporarily makes it display as a integer.</p>
