    <h1><strong>Hello Classmates and Teachers!</strong></h1>
    <p>My name is Rebecca. I was born in New Jersey, but I am coming here from Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. I love reading, walking, gardening and cats. I've been a vegetarian for over two decades.</p>
    <p> I've had a varied career from bartending, office work and animal rescue. While I have at various times enjoyed these jobs, particularly the rescue work, none of them have really engaged me. With the encouragement of friends and family I've decided to try to find a more fulfilling career path. This is the second bootcamp I've attended, the previous one covering mainly PHP, Drupal, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. You won't be able to tell about that from these blogs though! I am hoping that the tremendously useful language of Java that we will be learning will help me on my attempt at a new career path. I am looking forward to working with you all on that path.</p>
